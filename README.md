# VNrepo
The GITHUB repository for my (Rieley Cameron) visual novel, and my major work of the course.
To be updated when I remember to update the github instead of just working in a google docs lol

This game is accessible on both Mac and PC, but doesn't feature a Linus or mobile port for the game. The onl necessary pieces of hardware are a computer, monitor, and a mouse. A keyboard is desireable and can enhance the reading experience, but not necessary, as all interactions with the userface can be done through the mouse.

The game is not for the feint of heart and has descriptions of mental health which might make some players uncomfortable. By playing this game, you acknowledge that you understand the risk taken by reading and playing the game.
