Week 1 (29/4 - 3/5) 
Mainly setting up the document and such!!! Nothing big happening in this week or the next, but development and implementation for the project will start in the end of week 2/beginning of week 3. No roadblocks currently, other than navigating GitHub >:(

Week 2 (6/5 - 10/5)
Completed a Gantt Chart for the project!! Woohoo!! Again, same as last week where we're mainly developing implementation plans, the big task starts next week when I get to programming the solution lol.

Week 3 (13/5 - 17/5)
Started working on the development of the project!!! I plan to test the units individually upon completion (which might be difficult since I'm working in the one script file), but this is to ensure that each piece of the code works properly without needing to revise earlier parts and make it all fit together immediately (which is for later with integration testing). So far, the largest roadblock is setting up the random script in ren'py, and generating a random list of numbers (the first unit I'll be testing upon completion)

Week 4 (20/5 - 24/5)
More project work. This week I focused solely on the development of the screen the buttons will reside in, and next week is going to be implementing the ability to set them as either idle or lit states, so they'll alternate after the player presses them (which is what last week's random tool was for, to generate random buttons to switch states for the player). So far, this week's roadblock wasn't too tough, but as stated before I need to finish creating the interactive 'board' the buttons will reside on so I can test the modules' integration with one another necxt week.

Week 5 (27/5 - 31/5)
Finished setting up the board this week, and I did a round of integration testing to ensure I could click the highlighted buttons and switch their states back to unhighlighted (which worked, thankfully), so that means the majority of the project is completed, and now I just need to create a score, time tracker, and an ending results menu for players to choose if they want to play again or quit the game. I also implemented the writing and art assets used for the game, and tested them in a unit test to make sure everything ran smoothly. Next roadblock that I face will be creating the time and score keepers, and making the time count down during the game so there is a limit for the player. There are a few divergences from my original project, as it was originally going to be a rhythm-visual novel mix, but I realised in hindsight the scope would've been too large, and as such, have pivoted to a visual novel-reflex mix, as they use similar code segments (if, while, Boolean) and the minigame can represent that I've mastered these code practices within my work while being slightly easier.

Week 6 (3/6 - 7/6)
Completed working on the time/score keeper. I also added a countdown beforethe minigame started but after the preamble text, in order to introduce players to the minigame and give them time to prepare. I tested these both integrated with the other modules and as solo units, and they both worked as intended (first try, might I add), which means I'm ahead of schedule and can spend the majority of next week polishing the game in terms of adding comments to my code and finalising the end menu, which will take no time at all. At this pace, I intend to use the final week for theoretical work, as the major project will be complete.

Week 7 (10/6 - 14/6)
As planned, I was able to implement the menu easily in the first hour of this week, and the rest of my time has been dedicated to adding comments and fixing unnecessarily long parts of my code to make maintenance easier if it breaks. No roadblocks for this week, and next week will be completing theory work before the submission date of Friday the 21st.

Week 8 (17/6 - 21/6)
Final week. I have dedicated this week entirely to the theoretical compnent of this project. The largest roadblock is that writing makes my head hurt :( and that is all. This task will be submitted shortly.
